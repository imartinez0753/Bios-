# Bios-

My personal bios page
I have managed to push through the git bash which may not seem much to some but for me WOOOOOOOWHOOOOOOOO!!!!
managed to get the nav bar somewhat working.
testing git bash
I have yet to do any aesthetic stuff.
changed aesthetic to a teal theme
all buttons on nav bar work!
added photo of myself
added blurp
floated nav buttons right
floated image in index left so text would wrap
having trouble with padding and margins on smaller screens

---

portfolio pg.
added pics and cards
no cards are clickable but I wouldn't have anywhere to send them if they were
this is the hardest page on sm screens

---

contacts pg
not sure how to make any of the input save info should someone input their information
